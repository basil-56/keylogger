Sure, here's a sample `README.md` file for your keylogger project on GitHub:

# Secure Keylogger

This project implements a keylogger application capable of recording keystrokes and mouse events generated by user interactions anywhere on the screen. The recorded data is securely stored in an encrypted log file.

## Features

- **Mouse Event Logging**: Records mouse movements, clicks, and scrolls.
- **Keyboard Event Logging**: Records key presses and releases.
- **Secure Logging**: Encrypts the log data using Fernet symmetric encryption.
- **Multiprocessing**: Efficiently manages the logging process using Python's multiprocessing module.

## Architecture

The project is structured into three main modules:

1. **main.py**: Initializes and starts the mouse and keyboard listeners and manages the multiprocessing.
2. **events_tracker.py**: Contains the event handling functions for mouse and keyboard events, and manages the logging of these events.
3. **fernet_cipher.py**: Handles the encryption and decryption of the logs using the `cryptography.fernet` module.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Virtual Environment
- `pynput` library
- `cryptography` library

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-keylogger.git
    cd secure-keylogger
    ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv keylogger_env
    source keylogger_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `keylogger_env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

1. Ensure you have saved the provided code in respective Python files (`main.py`, `events_tracker.py`, `fernet_cipher.py`).
2. Run `main.py`:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## File Descriptions

- **main.py**: Initializes and starts the mouse and keyboard listeners, and manages the logging process.
- **events_tracker.py**: Contains event handlers for capturing mouse and keyboard events and logs them in an encrypted format.
- **fernet_cipher.py**: Handles encryption and decryption of log data using Fernet symmetric encryption.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure the encryption key is securely stored and managed.
- Use appropriate permissions to restrict access to the log files.
